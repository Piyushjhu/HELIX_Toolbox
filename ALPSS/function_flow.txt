Main Function: alpss_main

The main function that orchestrates the entire process is alpss_main. It calls the following functions in order:

spall_doi_finder: Finds the specific domain of interest in the larger signal.
carrier_frequency: Calculates the carrier frequency.
carrier_filter: Filters out the carrier frequency after the signal has started.
velocity_calculation: Calculates the velocity from the filtered voltage signal.
instantaneous_uncertainty_analysis: Estimates the instantaneous uncertainty for all points in time.
spall_analysis: Finds points of interest on the velocity trace.
full_uncertainty_analysis: Calculates uncertainties in the spall strength and strain rate due to external uncertainties.
plotting: Generates the final figure.
saving: Saves the output files if desired.


Supporting Functions
These functions are called within the main execution flow:

stft: Calculates the short-time Fourier transform.
num_derivative: Takes the numerical derivative of input array.
smoothing: Smooths the padded velocity data.
hl_envelopes_idx: Gets the indices for the upper and lower envelope of the voltage signal.
sin_func: General function for a sinusoid, used in curve fitting.
gauss: Gaussian distribution function.
fwhm: Calculates the full width at half maximum of a Gaussian distribution.
